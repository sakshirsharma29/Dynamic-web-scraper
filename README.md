# Dynamic-web-scraper

This Python project automates the process of collecting book data from BooksToScrape.com using Selenium and stores the extracted titles and prices in an Excel file using openpyxl.

It simulates a browser to navigate through multiple pages, scrape information for each book listed, and exports the results into a well-formatted spreadsheet. The project is a great demonstration of web scraping, automation, and data storage in Excel using Python.
